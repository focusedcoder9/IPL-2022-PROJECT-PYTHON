Hello Everone,
I am excited to share the project I recently completed ,that is IPL 2022 dataset using the lovely language python.
In this project following processes performed that is,
	Data load : 
        The first work is to be a load the data set in your tool,then the further processing.
	Data clean:
The second work is to clean your dataset in cleaning part such work that is remove nan check columns ,check datatype,etc.
	Data_processing:
Data processing is different from data clean Data processing involves a series of steps to           convert raw data into a more usable format.
	Data Transforming:
Data transformation is a critical step in data processing that involves converting data from its raw form into a format that is suitable for analysis or further processing
